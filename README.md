THE FORGE VERSION IS NO LONGER BEING UPDATED. PLEASE USE THE FABRIC VERSION

# XYKey
A mod that adds keybinds that make it easier to manage coordinates

Features:
- Send your position to chat
- Show your position on screen
- Send your position to chat with a name (e.g. ``Home: 105 64 -90``)
- Copy your position to clipboard

All of the Russian translations were made by [Husker](https://github.com/TheHusker). You can join his Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/53ZxcjgPFK)

This mod is centered around keybinds, and I would recommend the [Controlling mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controlling) to manage your keybinds
